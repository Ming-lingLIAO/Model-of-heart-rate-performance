# Model-of-heart-rate-performance
A model with multiple metabolic pathways to describe the performance curves with metabolic depression of marine molluscs.

All data processing was performed using the platform of the Matlab R2019a.

This model was developed by Gao-yang Li (University of Auckland, New Zealand) and Ming-ling Liao (Ocean University of China, China).

The code is partly based on the SCE-UA code by Qingyuan Duan (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7671-shuffled-complex-evolution-sce-ua-methodï¼‰
